# Emacs word processor mode
A wordprocessor-like emacs mode with Windows style key bindings.

Try in the text mode with the [solarize-12x29](https://github.com/talamus/solarize-12x29-psf) font!

(If `shift-arrowkey` selection does not work out-of-the-box, try to re-build the xterm info. There's an over a decade old bug in there...)
